Write Documentation

even on the web in blog posts, articles.

Submit Feedback
---------------

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/eladnoor/component-contribution/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome ;)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``component-contribution`` for local
development.

1. Install `git-lfs <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`__. On many linux
   distributions this can be installed from official package managers.  2. Fork
   the ``component-contribution`` repo on GitHub.  3. Clone your fork locally::

    git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/component-contribution.git

4. Create a branch for local development::

    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature-branch

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the quality
   control::

    tox

To get tox, just pip install it.

6. Commit your changes using `semantic commit messages
   <https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages>`__ and push your
   branch to GitHub::

    git add .  git commit -m "feat: your detailed description of your changes"
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request to this repository through the GitHub website.
