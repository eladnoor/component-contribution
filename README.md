## Requirements

### Python Version

* Python 3.5+
* (optional) ChemAxon's Marvin >= 5.11
* from PyPI:
  - numpy>=1.14.0
  - scipy>=1.0.0
  - pandas>=0.23.0
  - openbabel>=2.4.0
  - requests>=2.18.0

### MATLAB Version

* Matlab >= 7
* python == 2.7
* numpy >= 1.14.0
* scipy >= 1.0.0
* pandas >= 0.23.0
* Open-Babel >= 2.3.1 ('babel' must be in PATH, including python bindings)
* ChemAxon's Marvin >= 5.11 ('cxcalc' must be in PATH)

## Installation

### Windows

* install Anaconda 5.1 for Windows (recommended python 3.6 version)
* install the openbabel package
  - [conda package](https://anaconda.org/openbabel/openbabel)
* optional: install "Marvin Suite" by ChemAxon
  - Marvin is only required for adding structures of new compounds that are not
    in the KEGG database
  - [instructions](https://chemaxon.com/products/marvin/download)
  - add `cxcalc.bat` to PATH
  - you will need to get a license to use ChemAxon (it is free for academic use)

### Ubuntu

* as root: `apt install libopenbabel-dev`
* as root: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* optional: install "Marvin Suite" by ChemAxon
  - only required for adding structures of new compounds that are not in the
    KEGG database
  - [instructions](https://chemaxon.com/products/marvin/download)
  - add `cxcalc` to PATH, e.g. using a symbolic link from `/usr/bin/cxcalc`
  - you will need to get a license to use ChemAxon (it is free for academic use)

### Development

If you want to help developing the component-contribution package you need
[`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Please also take a look at the
[contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING .rst).

## Description of files in /data

* `compounds.tsv` - table of all KEGG compounds, their name and InChI (used only
  in Matlab code)
* `fixed_mapping.tsv` - table mapping some KEGG compound IDs to BiGG IDs
  (overriding the InChI-based mapping)
* `formation_energies_transformed.tsv` - table of biochemical formation energies
  (used for training CC)
* `kegg_additions.tsv` - table of compounds that are missing from KEGG together
  with their InChI
* `kegg_compounds.json.gz` - JSON of all KEGG compounds including their InChI
  and names
* `redox.tsv` - table of reduction potentials (used for training CC)
* `TECRDB.tsv` - table of K'eq values from the NIST database
  (http://xpdb.nist.gov/enzyme_thermodynamics/)
